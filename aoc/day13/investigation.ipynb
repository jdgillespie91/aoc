    "The [task](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/13) today is to determine the severity of a trip through a firewall. In this case, the firewall is made up of several layers. In each layer there is a scanner that moves up and down. The idea is that we have a preset path (in part one at least) for which we must compute the severity; the number of times that we encounter the scanner.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's look in more detail at one of the layers. According to the task, a layer has a range and a depth. The range indicates how many steps the scanner has to travel across the layer. For example, the following layer has a range of three.\n",
